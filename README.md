# About
h264ify is a Chrome/Firefox extension that makes YouTube stream H.264 videos instead of VP8/VP9 videos.

Try h264ify if YouTube videos stutter, take up too much CPU, eat battery life, or make your laptop hot.

By default, YouTube streams VP8/VP9 encoded video. However, this can cause problems with less powerful machines because VP8/VP9 is not typically hardware accelerated.

In contrast, H.264 is commonly hardware accelerated by GPUs, which usually means smoother video playback and reduced CPU usage.

# Requirements
Google Chrome

Looking for the Firefox version? See: https://github.com/erkserkserks/h264ify-firefox

# Installation
Install from here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal

Note: [You may need to enable GPU acceleration as well] (http://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/enable-hardware-acceleration-in-chrome.html)
