# About
h264ify is a Chrome/Firefox extension that makes YouTube stream H.264 videos instead of VP8/VP9 videos.

Try h264ify if YouTube videos stutter, take up too much CPU, eat battery life, or make your laptop hot.

By default, YouTube streams VP8/VP9 encoded video. However, this can cause problems with less powerful machines because VP8/VP9 is not typically hardware accelerated.

In contrast, H.264 is commonly hardware accelerated by GPUs, which usually means smoother video playback and reduced CPU usage.

# Requirements
Google Chrome *or* Mozilla Firefox

# Installation
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal)

- [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/h264ify/)

To check that it's working, right click on a YouTube video and select "Stats for nerds". Verify that the codec being used is neither 'vp08' nor 'vp09'.

Note: [You may need to enable GPU acceleration as well](http://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/enable-hardware-acceleration-in-chrome.html)
